# WasteWatch App

An app made for CS 3240: Advanced Software Development at the University of Virginia. It is a whistleblower app for environmental violations, and features three different user types: anonymous, common, and admin. Anonymous users can submit reports without logging in, while common users will be able to see a list of their reports and see any updates to them. Admin users can view all reports and mark them as resolved with a resolve explanation.

Made using Django and Amazon S3 storage and originally hosted on Heroku. Implements Google OAuth for login.
